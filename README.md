# 19 Regimiento Hispano's site

Source code for the front and back end of the **Darkest Hour: Europe 44'-45'** clan's website.

The webv2 and webv3 folders are the current iterations of the site, using mostly plain html and js.

The Backend folder has a player fetching script that also greets clan members joining the game, and a scoreboard script that parses the player data and creates a database with the last played games and high-scores.

DISCLAIMER: I am recently trying to tidy everything up, and I used a lot of chatgpt for styling and misc. So this probably is a hot mess of code.
